d) *5 points* - Is there a clear maximum of the testing data performance in your plot?

e) *7 points* - Did you properly explain why Lasso gives the zero coefficeints? Did you plot the coefficients?

f) *7 points* - Did you check on 5 random folds that you get similar performance?

g) *10 points* - Did you compute error bars by looking at ranges over the 5 folds and repeat the plot from part e)?
