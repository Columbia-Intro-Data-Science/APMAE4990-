Website: http://speakinimages.com/data/
php-files:

- Contains the php files which write read/write data to the SQL database and present
the interface to the user. This is stored on my remote server speakinimages.com
- userid.php is the main php file which reads the data from the database and outputs it into tables on the site.
- write_events.php is a php script which writes the data to my SQL database. This program is modified depending on the particular
table and format of the event.


scraper-programs:

- Contains the program RAEventPageScraper.py which scrape event data listings page on RA. These files are then outputted
into files which are read by event-suggestors/RA_scrapedoutput_reader.py

nearest-neighbors-generators:

Contains RASparse_rowcol_generator.py which generates the row/column matrix entries for userid/events. Then RA_generate_neighbors.py
uses the output of this file and collaborative filtering to list nearest neighbors of each userid.

event-suggestors:

- RA_history_event_suggestions.py which generates recommendations from reading output of RA_scrapedoutput_reader.py and the users
event history (djs, promoters, venues). 
- RA_scrapedoutput_reader.py reads the raw output from RAEventPageScraper.py and generates a listing of each user/event with the djs/promoters outputed
on one line.
- RA_neighbors_event_suggestions.py generates event suggestions from finding events that the nearest neighbors found in RA_generate_neighbors.py produced
and listing them (up to a maximum of 10).
